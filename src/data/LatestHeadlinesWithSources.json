That requires observers to be able to watch every aspect of the voting and ballot-counting process without being intimidated or interfered with. So why is the very concept of poll observers now being attacked by liberals and why is the U.S. Justice Department failing to ensure that poll observers in the upcoming midterm elections are protected in the same manner as voters and election officials?

They would have been hard-pressed to capture the U.S. Senate majority if Democrats had flipped this seat. Deep-pocketed GOP groups spent heavily to ensure that didn't happen dumping over $50 million in attack ads against Barnes.",
